# JiraCommentor
Take screenshot and post it to jira as a comment.


I have been observing mobile testing from the close ground. 
There is considerable effort being spent day in and day out by mobile testers in finding defects, transferring the screenshots from mobile devices to the 
computer to be able to raise the defects in ALM solutions like JIRA etc. 
Adding to this the challenges like stability of usb cable connections with the device, transferring the file from the mobile device to the computer,
locating the file and uploading into the ALM solutions all drain down the productivity of the testers.

After looking at these problems of mobile testers, I have come up with innovative solutions "Jira Commentor" that will eliminate the hassles of transferring 
the screenshots of mobile devices to the computer, then writing down the comments as part of the defects.
The "Jira Commentor" app will help you attach the screenshot of the defect/issue along with the comments into the ALM solutions. 
This solution is available in the below GitHub link, please do try and pass on a word about it, if you like it. 

Also do reach back to me, if you have any queries/any enhancements that you would like.
Let me Know any customization you want, or let us know your idea like this,if that will increase your Team productivity,
we will develop it for you.
